# DadChat

My senior project, using Java, Thymeleaf, and JavaScript. 

DadChat is a social media web application for single fathers where they can support each other through having conversations in chat, 
creating events that others can join such as birthday parties, playdates, or even just a local dad hang out, and even a built in search
function for local resources such as lawyers, doctors, schools, daycare, etc. reviewed by other single fathers who may have a better idea
just what you are looking for.

Application uses Google Places, OAuth 2, and a PostresSQL database.
